      <p>I’m an animator who’s especially drawn to 3D work, where I get a lot of satisfaction from creating worlds, characters, and concepts that feel alive. My academic and professional experiences have given me a range of opportunities to grow, through projects at the University of Missouri and through my role on the training team at Acosta Group. Both have pushed me to experiment, problem-solve, and keep developing the art of telling stories through motion and design.</p>

      <p>This past year at Acosta Group has been a chance to see animation in a whole new light. I worked on training resources and creative communication, which showed me that animation doesn’t just live in the entertainment space. It can be a really powerful tool for explaining ideas, guiding people, and getting them engaged. Finding that balance between clarity and creativity gave me a new appreciation for just how flexible the medium can be, and it made me see animation as both practical and expressive.
</p>

      <p>Even though my specialty is 3D animation, what excites me most is the creative process itself. I actually welcome the frustrations and roadblocks that come with it, because they push me to think differently and come up with new solutions. Every project feels like an exploration; testing textures, adjusting rigs, playing with movement, and more often than not, those tough moments lead to my best work. For me, the process is just as important as the finished piece, and it’s what keeps me motivated as an artist.
</p>

      <p>Looking forward, I want to keep building on my storytelling abilities while collaborating on projects that challenge me. My goal is to keep sharpening my 3D skills while exploring how animation can connect with people emotionally and create immersive worlds. At the end of the day, I believe animation isn’t just about moving images. It’s about moving people. My hope is to contribute to projects that inspire, entertain, and leave a lasting impact, whether that’s in entertainment, education, or beyond.</p>
