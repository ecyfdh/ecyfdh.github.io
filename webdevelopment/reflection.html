      <p>Animation, for me, is the craft of sculpting time—shaping motion until it carries meaning. This semester pushed me to think beyond polish and focus on clarity: readable silhouettes, motivated arcs, and poses that communicate before a single frame plays. I learned to plan with thumbnails, block quickly, and only then add the nuance that makes moments feel alive.</p>

      <p>I’ve become more intentional with references. Instead of copying movement, I break it into beats—anticipation, action, overshoot—and test each beat in blocking. That mindset also made graph editor work less scary: spacing became a design choice, not a fight with tangents. The result is cleaner timing and a stronger sense of weight.</p>

      <p>Technically, I practiced rig hygiene and small tools that save hours later: naming conventions, non-destructive constraints, and viewport lighting for quick reads. I also built a habit of daily micro-studies—ten-to-twenty second cycles that target a single idea like follow-through or eye darts. They’re fast, but they compound.</p>

      <p>Professionally, my goal is story-driven 3D character work. Short term, I’m focusing on a tight reel: three short shots that each demonstrate a different strength—subtle acting, physicality, and multi-character interaction. Long term, I want to collaborate on projects where performance and design are inseparable, and where the animation serves the narrative above everything else.</p>
